### Hi,

I am Misir, Software Engineer with more than 6 years of experience. I stared my developer career as a freelance web developer on 2016. During this time my interest in startups rised and I become very hyped. So I wanted to invest my time in startups. I also like to help open source communities to grow. And I'm bad at copywriting, so let's stop self-promotion part here.

I'm currently CTO at [Fonibo](https://fonibo.com/en).

##### Maintaining:

- [Hive](https://github.com/hivedb/hive) - Lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart.
- [phonenumbers](https://github.com/fonibo/phonenumbers) - Phonelibrary validation & UI widget written in pure Dart (without any native bindings like libphonenumbers).
- [MeiliSearch Dart](https://github.com/TheMisir/meilisearch-dart) - MeiliSearch API in dart programming language.

*The projects above are ones I usually spend more time maintaining than others.*

##### My blog

You can read my personal blog articles here at [themisir.com](https://themisir.com). I'm usually posting about software engineering, life and startups - not specific on one topic.
