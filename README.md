### Hi,

I am Misir, developing software for more than 6 years. I've started my career as a freelance web developer on 2016. Currently spending my time in building startup and hacking open source projects. I'm interested in all levels of the software development from language, os, hardware development to building web frontend UIs for end users. Currently I'm mostly coding in C#, Dart, TypeScript and Golang. You can find various ways to contact me on [here](https://themisir.com/contact/).

I'm currently full-time CTO, Co-Founder at [Fonibo](https://fonibo.com/en).

##### Maintaining:

- [hive](https://github.com/hivedb/hive) - Lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart.
- [phonenumbers](https://github.com/fonibo/phonenumbers) - Phonelibrary validation & UI widget written in pure Dart (without any native bindings like libphonenumbers).
- [meilisearch-dart](https://github.com/TheMisir/meilisearch-dart) - MeiliSearch API in dart programming language.

*The projects above are ones I usually spend more time maintaining than others.*

##### My blog:

You can read my personal blog articles here at [themisir.com](https://themisir.com). I'm usually posting about software engineering, my life and startups - not specific on one topic.
